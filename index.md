# Introduction

<p>
  My computer science journey began early in my teen years. Things have come a long way since I was writing simple JavaScript games and making a program to predict March Madness games. The step-by-step computation thinking required for software engineering came naturally, but dedicated study and experience has allowed me to develop a range of other beneficial skills and habits. Coursework covered a wide range of core computer science skills. Some of these core skills include understanding agile workflow, working with data and algorithms, and secure development.

  I believe the good habits taught to me were of equal importance to the skills. Good habits are necessary for being a good team member and creating meaningful and lasting contributions. Habits like planning and documentation improve organization and make code more maintainable. Good communication keeps a team unified and keeps stakeholders in the loop. Keeping security in mind at all times catches problems before they explode. Being well-rounded involves keeping up good habits and not simply being skilled.

  In addition to picking up skills and habits, I showed positive characteristics such as ambition and adaptability. A good example is the work I did in an OpenGL course: for the 3D scene I was tasked with developing, I intentionally chose to recreate my electric guitar because of the irregular shape and varying textures. I opted for complexity so that I could feel a better sense of achievement and so that I could gain a deeper understanding of the material. Similarly, for this capstone project, I did not shy away from sockets because they were low level or complex, but instead happily figured out how they work so that I could fulfill the goals I had set previously. Getting by is not as satisfying as truly putting forth the effort to make something worthwhile or genuinely understanding the course material.

  The artifact I chose to use throughout this course was a chess program I wrote for fun last spring. The “View On GitHub” button at the top of the page links to the repository for the program and the zip and tar.gz buttons on the right download the project in those respective formats. This artifact was the first thing that entered my mind for this project for several reasons: I enjoyed making it because I enjoy chess; it reflects me well because I made it from scratch; and it has many components including a GUI, threading, data management, logic for rules, and logic for moves. As the code review and enhancements will show, there was also ample room for improvements to be done on this artifact.
